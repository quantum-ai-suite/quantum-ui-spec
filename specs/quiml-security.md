## QUIML Security Best Practices

QUIML (Quantum User Interface Markup Language) is a declarative UI framework that leverages YAML for templates, multi-language controllers, and cross-platform rendering (e.g., React for web, Qt for desktop, JavaFX). While its extensibility and AI integrations enable powerful interfaces, they also introduce potential risks like injection attacks, unsafe parsing, and privilege escalation. Drawing from established practices in YAML handling, declarative UI paradigms, and frameworks like React/Qt/JavaFX, these best practices focus on secure implementation, parsing, and runtime behavior. Always prioritize least privilege, input validation, and regular audits.

### 1. YAML Parsing and Template Security
QUIML's relaxed YAML syntax (with pre-processing for inline styles and hex colors) can expose vulnerabilities if not handled securely. Common issues include arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization or malformed inputs.

- **Use Safe Parsers:** Always employ safe loading methods to prevent code injection. For example:
  - In Python (PyYAML): Use `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()`.
  - In JavaScript (js-yaml): Set `safe: true` or use equivalent safe modes.
  - In Java (SnakeYAML): Enable strict parsing and avoid dynamic class loading.
  - In C++ (yaml-cpp): Validate schemas before parsing.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all QUIML files before parsing. Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema adapted for YAML) to enforce structure, rejecting unexpected keys or values.
- **Pre-Processor Hardening:** Ensure the custom pre-processor (for expanding inline mappings and quoting specials like `#`) runs in a sandboxed environment. Limit file access to trusted paths.
- **Avoid Dynamic Features:** Disable YAML anchors/aliases if not needed, as they can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) via infinite recursion.

### 2. Controller System Security
Controllers (in JS, Python, C++, Java) handle logic and events, making them a vector for script injection or escalation.

- **Language Filtering:** As per package design (e.g., `quantum-ui-java-javafx` only loads Java controllers), ignore non-native languages to prevent cross-language exploits.
- **Sandboxing:** Run controllers in isolated environments:
  - Web (React): Use Web Workers or iframes for untrusted scripts.
  - Desktop (Qt/JavaFX): Employ process isolation or restricted permissions.
- **Input Sanitization:** Validate event data and bindings to prevent injection (e.g., SQL/XSS in AI-driven updates).
- **Privilege Control:** Controllers should not have direct file/system access; use APIs for interactions.

### 3. Extensibility and API Security
APIs like `registerType`, `registerAttribute`, and `registerBehavior` allow custom components but could enable malicious registrations.

- **Access Controls:** Restrict extension APIs to privileged code (e.g., admin mode). Validate configs for safe defaults and apply functions (e.g., no eval-like ops).
- **Type Referencing:** For external `.quiml-types` files, verify signatures or load only from trusted sources to avoid tampering.
- **Runtime Checks:** Audit registrations for potential side effects; limit to known-safe native implementations (e.g., no arbitrary code in apply handlers).

### 4. Styling and Rendering Security
Inline styles, external CSS, and dynamic theming can introduce CSS injection or resource leaks.

- **Sanitize Styles:** Parse and filter style objects/CSS files for unsafe properties (e.g., block `url()` in untrusted CSS to prevent data exfiltration).
- **Platform-Specific:**
  - Web (React): Prevent XSS by escaping dynamic content; use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict styles/scripts.
  - Qt: Validate QSS for safe selectors; avoid remote loading.
  - JavaFX: Use secure CSS loading with HTTPS; encrypt sensitive styles.
- **Dynamic Updates:** For `updateStyle`, validate inputs against whitelists to avoid overriding critical properties.

### 5. Bindings, Animations, and AI Integrations
Dynamic features like data bindings and WebSocket/GraphQL for AI can expose data or enable DoS.

- **Data Validation:** Sanitize sources/targets in bindings to prevent leaks or injections (e.g., use serializers for two-way sync).
- **Animation Limits:** Cap durations/infinites in animations to avoid performance-based DoS.
- **Secure Connections:** Mandate HTTPS/TLS for WebSocket/GraphQL; implement auth tokens and rate limiting.

### 6. Cross-Platform and Deployment Best Practices
QUIML's multi-platform nature requires tailored defenses.

- **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan/update libraries (e.g., React v19.2, Qt 6.10) using tools like Snyk for vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Deployment:** 
  - Web: Enforce HTTPS, anti-CSRF tokens.
  - Desktop: Sign binaries, use sandboxing (e.g., AppArmor on Linux).
- **Testing and Auditing:** Integrate security scans in CI/CD (e.g., static analysis for YAML, fuzzing for parsers). Perform penetration testing on rendered UIs.

Implement these iteratively, starting with parser security. For production, consider formal verification or third-party audits. If integrating with sensitive systems, consult framework-specific guides (e.g., React Security docs).
